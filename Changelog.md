update 2015-03-14
======================
* update the update client - this page. it should be more useful then the git commit messages
* rewriting the manual. this is still work in progress ....
* added support for the Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+ and probably other ARM based devices.
This is still experimental but it looks very promising.
The RasbPi will act as a stand alone VPN router for you network with support for all PIA-Tunnel features.
