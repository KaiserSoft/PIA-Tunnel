  these notes should be easier to read then the commit messages below
* Optimized javascript on "Overview" page and slowed down page reload.

* Working on a new Documentation. Link under "Tools" or [New Manual](./docs/index.html)

This is still experimental but it looks very promising.
The RasbPi will act as a stand alone VPN router for you network with support for all PIA-Tunnel features.

These will be turned into an installation script later on.
