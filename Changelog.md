======================
* added release notes to the update client - this box.
  these notes should be easier to read then the commit messages below
* Optimized javascript on "Overview" page and slowed down page reload.
* Added new setting under "Advanced Settings" to control the reload of the "Overview" page
* Updated SOCKS5 software to dante 1.4.1
* few optimizations here and there....
* Working on a new Documentation. Link under "Tools" or [New Manual](./docs/index.html)
* added support for the Raspberry Pi 1 Model B+ and probably other ARM based devices.
This is still experimental but it looks very promising.
The RasbPi will act as a stand alone VPN router for you network with support for all PIA-Tunnel features.
[Rasberry Pi Setup Instructions](./docs/index.html#pi_setup).
These will be turned into an installation script later on.
